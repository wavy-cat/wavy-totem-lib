# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with TotemLib, from installation to creating your first totem.

## Installation

TotemLib can be installed using various package managers:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="uv" label="Using uv" default>
    ```bash
    uv add wavy-totem-lib
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry" label="Using Poetry">
    ```bash
    poetry add wavy-totem-lib
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="Using pip">
    ```bash
    pip install wavy-totem-lib
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to create a totem from a Minecraft skin:

```python
from wavy_totem_lib import TotemBuilder, Skin

# Create a builder with your skin file
builder = TotemBuilder(
    Skin('my_skin.png'),
    round_head=True  # Optional: round the head corners
)

# Build the totem
totem = builder.build()

# Save the totem image
totem.image.save('my_totem.png')
```

This will generate a totem using the default WavyStyle and save it as 'my_totem.png'.

## Understanding the Process

The process of creating a totem involves three main steps:

1. **Loading the skin**: The `Skin` class loads a Minecraft skin file and provides access to its different parts.
2. **Building the totem**: The `TotemBuilder` class takes the skin and applies a style to create a totem.
3. **Saving or using the result**: The resulting `Totem` object contains the totem image, which can be saved or further processed.
