This guide will help you get started with the TotemLib library, from installation to creating your first totem.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add the library to your project using the following terminal command:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="uv">

```sh
uv add wavy-totem-lib
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="poetry">

```sh
poetry add wavy-totem-lib
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pip">

```sh
pip install wavy-totem-lib
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Writing a Simple Program

To verify the library is installed and working correctly, and for a brief demonstration, write a simple program:

```python
from wavy_totem_lib import TotemBuilder, Skin

# Create a Skin instance with your skin file
skin = Skin('my_skin.png')

# Create a totem builder based on the Skin instance
builder = TotemBuilder(
    skin,
    round_head=True  # Optional: round the edges of the head
)

# Build the totem
totem = builder.build()

# Save the totem image to my_totem.png
totem.image.save('my_totem.png')
```

This code will load [your skin](/guides/downloading-the-skin) from the `my_skin.png` file, generate a totem, and save it to `my_totem.png`.

If you can see your totem, the library is working correctly. Continue exploring the documentation!
